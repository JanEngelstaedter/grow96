# grow96

This R package was written to facilitate the import, wrangling and
analysis and bacterial growth data produced by microplate spectrometers.
Currently, this package is closely aligned with the specific needs and
instruments of the Engelstaedter/Letten group and hence intended for
internal use only.

## Installation

To install the package, you can run the following two lines of code in
R:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JanEngelstaedter/grow96")
```
